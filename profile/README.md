## Hi there 👋
We are [FRC Team 1885](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1885) Comet Robotics, previously known as ILITE. We are excited to apply our learning from the classrooms to a competitive enviorment through FRC Robotics. Comet Robotics has an organized structure containing 5 different sub-teams. These sub-teams include build, programming, electronics, graphics, and outreach. We also aim to promote a sense of student leadership and guidance.
